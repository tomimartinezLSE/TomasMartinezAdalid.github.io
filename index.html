    <!-- HTML is heirarchial: tags like this define elements on the page. 
        Each tag does something different. For example:
            - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
            - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
            - The <p> tag defines a paragraph.
        -->

<head>    
    <!-- The head tag links to resources our page needs and defines information about it. Tags in the <head> aren't displayed on the page. -->

    <!-- This is a link to a stylesheet which contains rules about how each element on the page should be defined-->
    <!-- Try swapping example1.css to another, and take a look at example1.css to see if you understand it-->

        This HTML file provides a simple template for a portfolio page. It contains a header, a few sections, and a few charts. This header can act as a summary for your page.
    </h3>

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>Section 1: A basic chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                We've organised the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description. Here, we can describe the chart and give some context.
                As a first example, we're using the basic chart from the previous session.

                This is a more advanced chart. We'll cover charts like this in more detail later today. Don't worry if you don't understand it yet.
                Feel free to replace both charts with your own examples.

        // Do you want to add more graphs?
        // try defining a new variable for figure_3_spec, adding VegaEmbed for figure_3, and adding a new section in the HTML
        // e.g. 
        // var figure_3_spec = ...
